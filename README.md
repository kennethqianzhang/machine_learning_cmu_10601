These are some Python Coding examples from CMU 10-601: Introduction to Machine Learning (Graduate Level), and the training codes I created for my previous employer and current students, in order to demonstrate only basic level of my programming skill. More advanced examples cannot be uploaded here directly due to confidencial concerns.
